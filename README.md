Stochastic Local Search: Cross Word Puzzle 
Methods Involved in Code:
1) Create a foundational class for search problems. 
2) Define a class to represent connections between nodes in a search problem. 
3) Develop a base class for objects that can be visually represented. 
4) Implement a class for basic local search strategies. 
5) Create a function to select a random element from a set. 
6) Establish a class for a modifiable priority queue. 
7) Design a class to represent a variable in a constraint satisfaction problem. 
8) Create a class to define constraints within a constraint satisfaction problem. 
9) Construct a class to represent a constraint satisfaction problem. 
10) Develop a function that establishes a constraint for nodes that must meet at a specific 
position. 
11) Specify some variables and constraints for a crossword puzzle.
